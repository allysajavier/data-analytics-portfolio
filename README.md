# Data Analytics Portfolio
## About 
Hi! I’m Allysa, a graduating AB Psychology student with a minor in Data Science at De La Salle University - Manila. I was accepted into the university’s Data Science program in July 2023. Throughout my academic journey, I had the opportunity to take courses such as Principles of Data Science, Data Visualization, Data Mining and Statistics, and Introduction to Machine Learning.

During my studies, I honed my skills in Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. I also built statistical models and developed machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics. At the same time, I was able to tap into my degree in Psychology, integrating psychological concepts in my data interpretations for deeper and more meaningful insights.<br/>

This portfolio showcases the projects I have completed as part of my coursework. It includes individual and group notebooks that demonstrate my proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.<br/>

## Projects 
### Machine Learning Prediction of Building Energy Efficiency Based on Architectural Parameters and Weather Data
**Notebook:** [Machine Learning Prediction](Machine_Learning_Prediction_of_Building_Energy_Efficiency_Based_on_Architectural_Parameters_and_Weather_Data.ipynb).<br/>
**Objective:** The project aims to predict energy efficiency based on building design and environmental factors to reduce operational costs, energy bills, and greenhouse gas emissions among others. This helps different organizations build a sustainable future by designing infrastructures that combat the carbon footprint brought about by population growth and rapid urbanization.<br/>
**Skills:** Data preprocessing, data engineering, data visualization, data analysis, machine learning and modeling. 

### Advanced Regression Techniques 
**Notebook:** [Regression Techniques](Advanced_Regression_Techniques.ipynb)<br/>
**Objective:** Predict the specific numeric price of a house based on its characteristics.<br/>
**Skills:** Data preprocessing, data engineering, data visualization, data analysis, machine learning and modeling.<br/>
