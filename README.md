# Data Analytics Portfolio
## About 
Hi! I am Allysa, a graduating AB Psychology student with a minor degree in Data Science at De La Salle University-Manila. I was accepted in the university's data science program in July 2023 and throughout my academic journey, I had the opportunity to learn courses such as the Principles of Data Science, Data Visualization, Data Mining and Statistics, and Introduction to Machine Learning. 
During my studies, I had the opportunity to hone my skills in Python to analyze and clean datasets, create effective data visualizations, build statistical models, and develop machine learning algorirthms for predictive analysis. At the same time, I was able to tap into my degree in Psychology, integrating psychological concepts in interpreting various data analysis.

The following portfolio documents previous projects I completed  for the relevant courseworks stated above. This portfolio includes notebookes that I have worked on individually and in groups, demonstrating my proficiency in data analysis. 

## Projects 
### Machine Learning Prediction of Building Energy Efficiency Based on Architectural Parameters and Weather Data
**Notebook:** [Machine Learning Prediction](Machine_Learning_Prediction_of_Building_Energy_Efficiency_Based_on_Architectural_Parameters_and_Weather_Data.ipynb).
**Objective:** The project aims to predict energy efficiency based on building design and environmental factors to reduce operational costs, energy bills, and greenhouse gas emissions among others. This helps different organizations build a sustainable future by designing infrastructures that combat the carbon footprint brought about by population growth and rapid urbanization. 
**Skills:** Data cleaning, data visualization, machine learning, and predictive modeling 

### Advanced Regression Techniques 
**Notebook:** [Regression Techniques](
